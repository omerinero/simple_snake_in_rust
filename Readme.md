# Snake game made in Rust <img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/2382-rustacean.png" width="64">

This a simple Snake game made in Rust and based on the tutorial of **marcusbuffet** ( https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake )

It was very useful for me to learn Bevy's principles. During learning and extending the practice I have added states (such as Menu, Game and GameOver) to the game.
I also added some UI to make it more user friendly.

Feel free to use it as you want in your learning path.
